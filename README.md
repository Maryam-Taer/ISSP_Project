### **Company Profile:** <br/>
BCIT is the largest Computing and IT education provider in Western Canada with over 30 applied computing programs. Whether you're just starting your
post-secondary education or you're a seasoned professional looking for the best skills to advance your career in tech we have something for you on our
Vancouver or Burnaby campuses. With 700 courses every year start with just one course or work toward a certificate diploma or degree either full or parttime. <br/><br/>

### **Project Description:** <br/>
Through this project, we aim to upgrade the current [website](https://issp.bcit.ca/) that enables us every year to organize the Industry Sponsor Student Projects (ISSP). <br/><br/>


### **Project Problem Statement:**<br/>
The current post processing of ISSP submissions requires the clientâ€™s manual input with external services, such as google sheet. It is a tedious, time-consuming and inefficient error-prone process. <br/><br/>

### **Proposed Solution:**<br/>
To improve the functionality of the submission process, we decided to integrate some additional features that we listed in high-level key features (Section 4.3). The website will be built using Node.js, using MySQL as the database and host on the plesk platform provided by the client. The team will also ensure that the submissions will be transferred into a properly viewable word/pdf document for students and faculty members.<br/><br/>

### **Key features:** <br/>

    1. Project submission Form
    2. Integration with MySQL database
    3. Accounts/Credentials to Login for faculty members & staff
    4. Datatable to fetch and view projects from MySQL
    5. Auto Documents generation (PDF, Word)
    6. Interface(s) to filter/Edit/Categorization projects
    7. Interface to make notes/comments/feedback on each project
    8. Accounts/Credentials to Login for faculty members & staff 

    Out of scope:
    1. Automated Google Sheet generation
    2. Integration of Login with BCIT credentials
    3. Sponsor Contact Catalogue/Ranking
    4. Auto Invoice Generation

### **Technologies:** <br/>
| Database | Framework(s) | Language(s) | Version Control | Environment | UX-UI |
|  :---:   |     :---:    |     :---:   |      :---:      |     :---:   | :---: |
| MySQL / MariaDB   | AngularJS     | Node.js    | Git | Plesk | Bootstrap / CSS

<br/><br/>
### **Alternative Technology Solution:**<br/>
We are using node.js and MySQL as the database in this project; however, another alternative could be Python and MySQL/MariaDB as the database. We can also consider using some cloud databases, such as firebase, AWS, and Azure. As our sponsor mentioned, no existing competitors or other universities offered a solution to develop and improve the current website.<br/><br/>
